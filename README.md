# Project 4: AI Chat

### Aboout The Project
Overview:
- This AI chat is designed to blend human interaction, AI assistance, and coding support into one platform. Powered by React, Redux Toolkit, Node.js, OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT API, and ChatEngine, AIChat provides a dynamic environment for users to engage in real-time conversations, solve coding problems, and ask questions across various topics. 
- Firstly, users can communicate with friends, colleagues, or new acquaintances through secure, real-time text messaging. The application also supports direct messaging and group chats with media capability.
- Secondly, users can also get help on coding problems, general knowledge, or creative ideas through the application's integrated ChatGPT AI which provides accurate, context-aware answers, making it the perfect tool for learning, brainstorming, and problem-solving.
- Lastly, the application's auto-fill sentence feature powered by the ChatGPT API, predicts the completion of your sentences and suggests contextually appropriate text, making communication faster and smoother.
